# CHANGELOG

All notable changes to this maintained fork will be documented in this file.

## [2026-05-16] — Naming Cleanup, Earthquake Removal & Git Structure

### Tier 2: Deprecated service naming cleanup
- Renamed forecast data files: `awd.txt` → `forecast_daily.txt`, `awh.txt` → `forecast_hourly.txt`
- Renamed forecast PHP files: `forecast3aw.php` → `forecast3om.php`, `forecast3awlarge.php` → `forecast3omlarge.php`
- Renamed popup files: `pop_aeris_{hourly,hourly_table,daynight,daynight_table}.php` → `pop_forecast_*`
- Config variables renamed: `AWD_PATH`/`AWH_PATH` → `FORECAST_DAILY_PATH`/`FORECAST_HOURLY_PATH`
- CSS classes: all `darksky*` renamed to `forecast*` across both themes and all PHP files
- All references updated: `settings1.php`, `initial_settings1.php`, `index.php`, `pop_menu_forecast.php`, `templateSetup.php`, `scripts/`, `.gitignore`

### Tier 3: Weather Underground attribution corrected
- `wu.txt` forecast data is fetched from IBM The Weather Company API (`api.weather.com/v3`), not Weather Underground's defunct public API
- Updated attribution in `outlookwu.php`, `pop_outlookwu.php`, `uvindexwu.php`, `templateSetup.php`, `settings.php`
- `menu.php` WU personal weather station link left unchanged (uploading to WU PWS network is a separate active service)

### Tier 4: DarkSky (ds) suffix removal
- `dsuvindex.php` → `uvindex.php`
- `uvindexds.php` → `uvindex_detail.php`
- `outlookds.php` → `outlook.php`
- `solaruvds.php` → `solaruv.php`
- These files use local weewx sensor data only; `ds` suffix was dead legacy naming from DarkSky era
- `templateSetup.php` reference updated

### Git structure: www/ path migration
- Original upstream tracked all files under `www/`; deployed Pi has files at web root
- Resolved 1,329 ghost `www/` entries via `git rm --cached -r www/`
- Re-tracked all PHP template files and CSS at correct root-level paths
- Added `css/icons/`, `css/fonts/`, `img/` to `.gitignore` — 925 static SVG icons not suited for a PHP fork repo

### Earthquake module removed
- Service non-functional since 2023 (earthquakereport.com API dead, `eq.txt` stale since Mar 2023)
- Deleted: `earthquake.php`, `eq.php`, `eq_uk.php`, `pop_eqlist.php`, `pop_eqlist_uk.php`
- Cleaned all references: `index.php`, `notify.php`, `shared.php`, `settings.php`, `updater.php`, `initial_settings1.php`, `templateSetup.php`
- Renamed `earthquake()` JS loader → `position3()` (generic slot loader); `$eqRefresh` → `$position3Refresh`
- Fixed copy-paste bug: `purpleairqualitymodule` position block was incorrectly linking to earthquake list (now links to `aqipopup.php`)
- `weather34card--earthquake1/2/3` CSS classes in UV/AQI files left intact — they are color-gradient definitions, not earthquake-specific

### EU alert module guard
- `top_advisory_eu.php`, `pop_europealerts.php`: added null guard for empty `awa.txt` response
- AerisWeather EU alerts not applicable for US stations; `awa.txt` returns empty response since AerisWeather trial expired (Apr 2026)

### AQI pipeline confirmed active
- `aq.txt` fetched hourly by weewx `aq` service from WAQI API (`api.waqi.info`)
- `update_aqi.sh` transforms `aq.txt` → `aqiJson.txt` (PM2.5/PM10 extraction) — no changes needed

## [2026-05] — API Migration: Open-Meteo / NOAA

### Forecast (awd.txt / awh.txt)
- Replaced AerisWeather forecast API (deprecated) with [Open-Meteo](https://open-meteo.com/) — free, no key, CC BY 4.0
- `scripts/nws_forecast_update.py`: fetches Open-Meteo 8-day forecast, writes Aeris-compatible JSON
- Fixed `icon1` → `icon` field name in `forecast3aw.php`, `pop_aeris_hourly.php`, `pop_aeris_hourly_table.php`, `pop_aeris_daynight.php`, `pop_aeris_daynight_table.php`
- Today's daytime icon now derives from afternoon hourly WMO codes (not the daily worst-case which includes overnight rain)
- Night forecast periods now display "Clear" / "Mostly Clear" instead of "Sunny"
- Known limitation: daily humidity field unavailable from Open-Meteo daily endpoint (shows 0); hourly humidity is correct

### METAR Current Conditions (me.txt)
- Replaced CheckWX API with [aviationweather.gov](https://aviationweather.gov/) (NOAA/AWC) — free, no key, public domain
- `scripts/metar_update.py`: fetches METAR, writes CheckWX-compatible JSON to `me.txt`; `metar34get.php` unchanged
- Added `metar34sky.php`: lightweight sky icon/description parser with no conflicting includes (safe to use in any PHP context)
- Fixed `currentconditionsw34.php`: now uses METAR sky icon, description, and visibility rather than stale `awc.txt` and broken `cloud_cover` field (was always 0 due to missing realtime data field 204)
- Updated `pop_metarnearby.php` API Info section: NOAA logo and link replacing CheckWX

### Weather Alerts
- Replaced EU MeteoAlarm / Weather Underground advisory module (both non-functional for US users) with [NWS Alerts API](https://www.weather.gov/documentation/services-web-api) — free, no key, public domain
- `scripts/nws_alerts_update.py`: fetches active alerts for configured NWS zones, writes `nws_alerts.txt`
- `top_advisory_nws.php`: colour-coded severity display (Extreme=red, Severe=orange, Moderate=yellow, Minor=blue, clear=green)
- `settings1.php`: `position4` switched from `top_advisory_rw.php` to `top_advisory_nws.php`

### Configuration & Privacy
- `scripts/w34config.example.py`: template for all site-specific settings (lat/lon, ICAO, NWS zones)
- `scripts/w34config.py`: gitignored — actual station coordinates and identifiers never committed
- All three scripts import from `w34config` at runtime; no location data in any committed file

### Cron (www-data)
```
15 * * * *   /usr/bin/python3 /usr/local/bin/nws_forecast_update.py >> /var/log/nws_forecast.log 2>&1
*/15 * * * * /usr/bin/python3 /usr/local/bin/metar_update.py >> /var/log/metar_update.log 2>&1
*/5 * * * *  /usr/bin/python3 /usr/local/bin/nws_alerts_update.py >> /var/log/nws_alerts.log 2>&1
```

## [2026-05-16] — Cloud Cover, Forecast Fixes & UI Corrections

### Cloud Cover Chart (cloudcoverplot)
- `scripts/cloud_cover_update.py`: fetches Open-Meteo hourly `cloudcover`, patches weewx `signal8` field every 5 min via root cron
- `scripts/cloud_cover_backfill.py`: one-time script using Open-Meteo archive API to backfill all 248,383 zero records back to March 2022
- `scripts/fix_sat24.py`: overwrote 193,852 pre-Jan-2024 records stored in sat24.com okta scale (0–2) with correct Open-Meteo percent values (0–100)
- Rebuilt weewx daily summaries (`wee_database --drop-daily --rebuild-daily`) to reflect corrected archive data
- Dashboard link switched from `span='weekly'` (7 days) to `span='yearly'` (4-year history with 1d/1w/1m/6m/1yr/All)
- Chart type changed from `column` → `area` for yearly view; restored both Max and Avg series
- `plotOptions.area.dataGrouping.approximation` set to `'average'`: auto-grouped bars now show mean cloud cover, not sum (prevented 564% readings when multiple days were condensed into one bar)
- Apache no-cache headers added for `w34highcharts/` directory; `?v=` cache-buster added to `plots.js` script tag

### Forecast Popup Fixes (pop_aeris_* files)
- Fixed `['weather']` → `['weatherPrimary']` field name in all four forecast popouts (condition text was blank)
- Fixed rain display: amount and probability now shown separately (`0.13 in · 45% chance`)
- Fixed daily humidity showing `0%`: `nws_forecast_update.py` now aggregates hourly humidity from Open-Meteo into day/night periods
- Fixed tonight showing "Sunny" instead of "Clear" in night periods
- Fixed today's forecast icon using daily worst-case code (caused rain icon all day after morning showers cleared)
- Fixed `=` vs `==` bug in rain block causing it to always display even on dry hours

### Attribution & Repo Cleanup
- Updated all 47 references from `steepleian/weewx-Weather34` → `meisnick/weewx-Weather34`
- Forecast popout attribution updated: AerisWeather → Open-Meteo (CC BY 4.0), Yr.no → basmilius/weather-icons (MIT)
- Table-style forecast popouts now include attribution footer (previously had none)
- SSH access setup: key-based auth (`~/.ssh/pi_id`), `~/.ssh/config` Host alias `pi`, no-cache Apache config committed
- `CLAUDE.md` updated with SSH alias instructions

### Known Issues (updated)
- Open-Meteo daily humidity fix landed — hourly data correct, daily aggregated from hourly ✓
- sat24.com cloud cover data corrected via historical backfill ✓
